# CAOS Sublime Builder

This Tool can be used in Combination with the [CAOS Sublime Package](https://github.com/Ham5ter/sublime_caos_support) to Inject CAOS Script directly from Sublime Text 2 into Games, based on the [Creatures Evolution Engine](http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Creatures_Evolution_Engine).

But of Course you can use it without Sublime i.E. with Notepad++ or directly via Commandline.
